In this project I wrOte a function that determines whether or not a password
is good. I define a good password to be a one that is at least 8 characters
long and contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at
least one number. The function returns true if the password passed to it as
its only parameter is good. Otherwise it returns false. I've included a main program
that reads a password from the user and reports whether or not it is good. The main program 
only runs when solution has not been imported into another file.
