In this project I wrote a function named isInteger that determines
whether or not the characters in a string represent a valid integer. When determining
if a string represents an integer, it ignores any leading or trailing white space.
Once this white space is ignored, a string represents an integer if its length is at least
1 and it only contains digits, or if its first character is either + or - and the first
character is followed by one or more characters, all of which are digits.
The main program reads a string from the user and reports whether or
not it represents an integer. The main program will not run if the file
containing solution is imported into another program.
