Many people do not use capital letters correctly, especially when typing on small
devices like smart phones. In this project, I wrote a function that capitalizes
the appropriate characters in a string. A lowercase “i” will be replaced with an
uppercase “I” if it is both preceded and followed by a space. The first character in
the string will also be capitalized, as well as the first non-space character after a
“.”, “!” or “?”. For example, if the function is provided with the string “what time
do i have to be there? what’s the address?” then it should return the string “What
time do I have to be there? What’s the address?”. I included a main program that reads
a string from the user, capitalizes it using function, and displays the result.
