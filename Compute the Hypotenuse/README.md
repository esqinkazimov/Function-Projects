The function takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as
its parameters. It returns the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean
theorem, as the functionâ€™s result. I included a main program that reads the lengths of
the shorter sides of a right triangle from the user, it uses function to compute the
length of the hypotenuse, and displays the result.
