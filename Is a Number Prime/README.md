A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by one and itself.
The function determines whether or not its parameter is prime, returning
True if it is, and False otherwise. The main program reads an integer
from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is prime. 
The main program will not run if the file containing solution is imported
into another program.
